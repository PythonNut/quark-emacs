Changes / Selected Bug Fixes in 14.09:
   * [Julia]: Executable is changed to `julia'.

   * [Julia]: Completion and help system was adjusted to Julia v.0.3.0.
     Julia v.0.2.x is no more supported.

   * [R]: Running R with `gdb' debugger now works as expected

   * : Inferior ESS buffers are now derived from `comint-mode'

   * [R]: `ess-execute-screen-options' uses correct screen width in
     terminal sessions

   * : `ess-build-tags-for-directory' works when no TAGS file name was
     provided

   * : `ess-continued-statement-offset' is now respected everywhere
     except inside of the `if' test condition.

   * : New variable `ess-first-continued-statement-offset' for
     indentation of the first line in multiline statements.

   * R: Starting `,' in multiline statements indentation is now ignored
     to achieve a more pleasant alignment.

   * R: Improved behavior of `RET' in roxygen blocks.

   * [R]: command cleaning with `C-u C-u C-y' was broken with lines
     containing " + "

   * [R]: fixed "empty watch window bug"

   * [R]: don't ask for help location on ac-quick-help (request of
     github #81)

   * [R]: "importClassesFrom" and "importMethodsFrom" were added to the
     list of two-parameter roxygen commands

   * [R]: fix vignetes display and hyperlinks (were broken in 13.09-1)

   * [Julia]: recognize function names ending with !

   * [Julia]: fix indentation of "for" comprehension syntax within
     brackets.

   Changes / Selected Bug Fixes in 13.09-1:
   * ess-remote and TRAMP: R support code is now downloaded in binary
     form instead of being injected from local machine. The R code is
     stored in `~/.config/ESSR/' directory on the remote machine

   * TRAMP: PAGER environment variable is now correctly set to
     `inferior-ess-pager'

   * retrieval of help topics on remote machines is fixed

   * org-babel: source references of R code executed from org files
     correctly point to source references in original org files
     (version 8.2.1 or higher of org-mode is required for this feature)

   * `ess-execute' is now bound to `C-c C-e C-e' in `ess-extra-map'.

   * completion works again in `ess-execute'

   * [R]: `head' and `tail' methods were replaced by `htsummary' in
     `ess-R-describe-object-at-point-commands'

   * [roxygen]: evaluation commands now work in roxygen blocks.
     Leading comments are automatically removed before the evaluation

   * [transcript]: 'Clean Region' now works with multiline statements;
     `ess-transcript-clean-region' etc. correctly treat  multiline
     statements, i.e., no longer forgets the lines typically  preceded
     by '+'

   * [SAS]: Three features/fixes with special thanks to Matthew Fidler
     https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pulls/mlf176f2
     (https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pulls/mlf176f2). Turn on SAS log
     mode when appropriate.  Indent comments and CARDS statement more
     appropriately.

   * [SAS]: `ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle' default returns to `nil'

   * [R]: support for `prettify-symbols-mode': contribution from
     Rudiger Sonderfeld `https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pull/65'

   * [SWV]: knitr now evaluates in the current frame

   * [developer]: ess-developer doesn't kill open DESCRIPTION files
     anymore

   * [roxygen]: `ess-roxy-preview-HTML' is now on `C-c C-o C-w' and
     `ess-roxy-preview-text' is now on `C-c C-o C-t'

   * : installation with `make install' was simplified and should work
     out of the box on most *nix systems

   *  installation instructions simplified

   * fixed font-lock bug introduced in 13.09 that was causing very slow
     process output

   Changes/New Features in 13.09:
   * font-lock in process buffers doesn't "spill" over prompts.
     Missing closing string delimiters should not cause wrong
     fontification of the following command input.

   * [julia]: full features M-TAB completion and auto-complete support,
     which now works for modules, structures and data types.

   * [julia]: a much better eldoc showing arguments of methods and data
     type constructors

   * ESS-developer:
        - ESS-developer work-flow pattern has been streamlined:
          ESS-developer is now automatically activated on per-file
          basis if the   file is part of a developed package
          `ess-developer-packages'. The   old behavior (activation on
          per-process basis) is still available on   `M-x
          ess-developer' in a process buffer.

        - integration with `devtools' package. New command
          `ess-developer-load-package' calls `load_all' on the package
          containing current file. `ess-developer-add-package' now
          offers IDO   menu completions with available loading methods,
          currently   `library', and `load_all'. Loading command can be
          customized   with `ess-developer-load-on-add-commands'.

   * `TAB' now indents region if region is active (a contribution of
     Matthew Fidler in pull #41)

   * `M-x ess-version' now reports full loading path and recognizes git
     and ELPA versions.

   * warning and error keyword are now highlighted with
     `font-lock-warning-face' as they should be, (for quite some time
     these keywords have been hijacked by compilation mode
     fontification).

   * eldoc: Eldoc now recognizes multiple processes.  If current
     process is busy, or current buffer is not associated with a
     process, eldoc picks its completions from the first available free
     process.

   * org-babel: evaluation is now org-friendly

   * help: new help buffers now try to reuse ess-help buffers.  This
     behavior is controlled by `ess-help-reuse-window' custom variable.

   * help: ?foo pops IDO menu on multiple help files (so far it worked
     only for `C-c C-v')

   * remote evaluation is considerably faster now on slow connections

   * [R] tracebug R source references regular expressions are (mostly)
     language agnostic.

   * `ess-function-call-face' inherits from
     `font-lock-function-name-face' rather than
     `font-lock-builtin-face'.

   * `ess-inject-source' now accepts `function-and-buffer' option.

   * Documentation: The "New Features" section (and `NEWS') now
     represent recent changes: within the last year or so.  All changes
     can be found in the new news.html (news.html) (or `NEWS' and
     `ONEWS').

   * [R] `ess-rep-regexp' should no longer inf.loop (rarely!), and
     hence `M-x ess-fix-miscellaneous' should neither.

   Changes/New Features in 13.05:
   * [gretl]: Support for `gretl' (both editing and sub-process
     interaction). A contribution of Ahmadou Dicko.
