* General
** risky-local-variable problem

check illegal eval.

** piki and html
add updated date and time
** annoying fsvn-result buffer.

** `merge' can use ediff-merge

** fsvn-xml-*-dtd-alist check original dtd.

** what is scheduled commit? `status' forth column.

** mode-line and easymenu

** some help mode (command brief description)

** file-select, message-edit can kill-buffer when committing.

** Bugreport

** about SVN_SSH
** Activate only magic name.

Disable all fsvn feature but only magic access.

** font-lock not works fine in some cases.
consider `font-lock-fontify' call or not

buffer name start with ` ' (space)

** tool-bar


** search log diff and message

Sometime want to grep svn history.
Search full of repository is bad idea. that is too heavy.
Cache repository? or cache diff output that between 1- revision?


** describe document about process-list 
enable send password
freezing processes.

** complete args fsvn-browse-* interactive

inhibit path completion.


** Consider using uuid string as message id directory
fsvn-message-edit-get-message-directory

** fsvn-*-default-args

Too complicated!

** global command
C-c v N command when git repository duplicated... switch like vc??

** create vc new backend?
fsvn-vc

** svn-auto-commit-mode

new minor mode commit when save-buffer

** distribute with mw32script.el

fix DOC/*
fix INSTALL

* magic
** `fsvn-magic-directory-files' accept svn:externals

** async drawing in dired.



* browse-mode
** Enable Move file (in a repository)

** move case wrong file by svn `move'

on windows 
fsvn-browse.*move-in-repository

** fsvn-browse-svn:externals-selected

from other repository

** async drawing

** colorize filename

modified status, conflict status


* select-file-mode
** TODO when commit file-select buffer has svn:external file.
** An instant viewer that for modified file or changed directory hierarchy.
  currently `*' mark is display committed files, not manipulated file.

** enable resolved

* message-edit-mode
** parasite-*-execute command accept optional argument

* completion
** fsvn-completing-url to parse a previous segment
** fsvn-completing-read-url behavior different general Emacs one.
** completing read implementation cleaning.
** fsvn-file-select hide/show non selected files.


* General (refactor)
** fsvn-command-args-canonicalize move to more critical point.
** fsvn-url-encode-string more critical point.
** case-sensitive when windows file-system only. (ex: fsvn-url-belongings-p)
** fsvn-magic-* inspect how to implements.

** fsvn-prop* code clean.

** libxml-parse-xml-region


* logview-mode
** fsvn-log-message-buffer-name, fsvn-log-sibling-buffer-name contains first space then fontify is not work.

** tortoise like log cache.

cache log xml file to ~/.fsvn/cache/logs/{md5}
each file contains one revision
revision range and log base url

** fsvn-log-list-mode GUI viewer.
 call tortoise viewer (Windows)


** patch
When property is changed, created patch wrong??


** async revert buffer

default range is current-revision 
1. target-path is /path/to/hoge@1234 range is 1000 - 1234
 this case failed if specify range 1000 - HEAD
 1000 - 1235 were succeed if rev.1235 is exists
2. target-path is /path/to/foo
 MINIMUM REVISION to HEAD is more specific. 

** revert buffer

when svn:log or svn:date was changed
   
* prop-mode
** prop-recursive-mode

proplist --recursive

** propedit and not changed value but want to apply recursively


* diff
** diff binary file invoke filter program. (Like OpenOffice file)

** ediff different coding-system

** create diff minor-mode?
C-c C-k kill diff process

* Other
** improve the UI about read arguments (ex --targets like argument not necessary in completion)


** fsvn-blae-minor-mode highlight specific revisions.

    fsvn-blame-minor-highlight-specific-revisions
    fsvn-blame-minor-highlight-log-regexp

** tsvn:lockmsgminsize, tsvn:logsummary, tsvn:projectlanguage

** git


*** like `git stash'


stash id is stash date {yyyyMMddHHmmss}

md5 is directory by directory-file-name.

~/.fsvn/stash/{md5 of directory name}/{yyyyMMddHHmmss}


*** cherry pick

pick patch and apply changes to any file.
with log message?

* svk

** Not familiar interface

** depotmap --init

not works on windows


* popup-result-mode

** `update' `merge' output

Currently buffer's point is not moved from (point-min)
Sometime prompt stop process, so cannot notice the prompt without scrolling.
Move to point-max? only update or merge (switch?)



* 1.7.x

** new subcommand
relocate

** new command
svnrdump

** --split
new subcommand

** test tortoise property
