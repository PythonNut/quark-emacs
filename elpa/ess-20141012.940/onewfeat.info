This is /tmp/ess4942I8w/ess-20141012.940/onewfeat.info, produced by
makeinfo version 4.13 from
/home/melpa/melpa/working/ess/doc/onewfeat.texi.

Changes/New Features in 5.14:
   * [BUGS/JAGS]:  Batch BUGS is back!  For recent OpenBUGS versions,
     3.0.8+, a batch BUGS script is once again available, but for Linux
     only.  Therefore, since it seems that BUGS and JAGS must co-exist
     (rather than a transition from BUGS to JAGS), .bug files are now
     in [BUGS] mode and .jag files are in [JAGS] mode.  [BUGS] now
     works like [JAGS] rather than the original mode [BUGS] mode which
     was difficult to maintain.  Although, [BUGS] appears to work,
     there still may be some features missing as well as bugs.

   * [R]: New customizable variable `ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p'
     Commands to Sweave current file and LaTeX the result are now
     available to AUCTeX users, if this variable is set to `t'.

   * [S]: `C-c C-c' (`ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step') is now
     skipping over comments as the other paragraph functions do.  It
     (and similar functions) should no longer wrongly find `function()'
     beginnings inside comments or strings.

   * [SAS]: improved by better support for GNU Emacs

   Changes/New Features in 5.13:
   * [R]: On Windows, for R 2.12.0 and later, the Rterm executables
     (in subdirectories i386 / x64) now are found as well as for
     earlier R versions.

   * [S+]: on Windows, both 32- and 64-bit versions of S+ ("S-PLUS")
     are found now and made available on the menu.

   * [R]: When prompting for a starting directory, the R version is
     (always?) correct now.

   * [R]: on non-Windows platforms, the `use-dialog-box'  variable is
     no longer temporarily changed (to `nil' for R-x.y.z version
     functions and to `t' for `R' itself), but rather the user
     customization is obeyed.

   * [R]: more Roxygen improvements.

   * `Rd-preview-help' now generates preview buffers with navigation
     facilities the same as regular help buffers.

   * : New functions and keys C-c [up] / [down]  for evaluating the
     buffer "from beginning till here".

   Changes/New Features in 5.12:
   * [SAS] Font-locking:  update of PROCs keywords (up to SAS 9.22);
     error/warnings.

   * [R]: Roxygen improvements: S4 classes;  also optionally keep
     spaces when filling arguments

   * [Rd]: support new keywords:  section-name \subsection plus a dozen
     "new" keywords; should match R  2.12.x now.

   * `ess-display-help-on-object' (`C-c C-v')  now _caches_ the list of
     topics, thus speeding up the improvement  feature introduced in
     5.9.

   Changes/New Features in 5.11:
   * Filename completion within buffers now adds only trailing
     characters to complete the filename, rather than expanding to an
     absolute file path.  This filename completion is bound to the TAB
     key.

   * `M-n P' in Sweave buffers now prompts for the command to run
     instead of using `pdflatex' unconditionally, offering completion
     from customizable collection `ess-swv-pdflatex-commands', the
     first of which is taken as default and that defaults to `texi2pdf'.

   * `M-RET' is now also bound in S language (R and S+) buffers to
     `ess-use-this-dir'. It sends `setwd(..)' to the S process to set
     the working directory to the one of the source file.

   Changes/New Features in 5.10:
   * `M-RET' in *S* buffers is now bound to `ess-dirs'.  This function
     will set Emacs's current directory to be the same as the *S*
     process.  This is useful if you use `setwd()' within a *S* process.

   Changes/New Features in 5.9:
   * Toolbar:  The toolbar now has an icon for starting Splus.

   * Indentation: New documentation and code has been added to make it
     easier to change how ESS indents code.  In particular, see
     `ess-default-style', `ess-own-style-list' and the documention
     subsection "Changing indentation styles".

   * `ess-display-help-on-object' (`C-c C-v') now offers  completion
     candidates for help file aliases, in addition to object  names.

   * Font locking: is now turned on  even without `window-system' is
     `nil', whenever  ESS-FONT-LOCK-MODE is non-nil, i.e., by default.

   *  script editing: ess-eval-deactivate-mark default is now t,  as
     suggested by Leo Alekseyev and subsequent "unanimous" ESS-help
     discussion.

   * [R]: Editing support for "#!" (Rscript / littler) editing,  thanks
     to Jeffrey Arnold.

   * [R]: Now finds all R versions, both 64-bit and 32-bit, on some
     64-bit Windows machines.  Please report back to ess-core success
     or failure  on your 64-bit Windows machine.

   * ESS Manual now more visually pleasing;
     `http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html'

   * [R]: Roxygen on XEmacs no longer font locks for now  (as it
     required missing features and hence broke ESS startup, there).

   * [R]: Roxygen has a sub-menu on the [ESS] menu.

   * [R]: Function `ess-rutils-htmldocs' in  `ess-rutils.el' offers an
     alternative to `help.start()' for  navigating R documentation,
     using the `browse-url' Emacs  function.

   Changes/New Features in 5.8:
   * [R]: New `ess-rutils.el' with utilities for listing, loading,
     installing, and updating packages, as well as object manipulation
     (listing, viewing, and deleting).  It also provides an alternative
     to `RSiteSearch()' that uses the `browse-url' function, so results
     can be viewed in an Emacs web browser.

   * [R]: much more extensive Roxygen interface, via ess-roxy.el  from
     Henning Redestig. Ess-roxy supports filling of roxygen fields,
     generation and updating roxygen templates, completion of roxygen
     tags,  basic navigation (marking and moving between entries),
     folding using  hs-minor-mode and preview of the Rd file.

   * Emacs lisp files have got better names (partly, for now).

   Changes/New Features in 5.7:
   * [R]: loading a source file (`C-c C-l') now works in  Windows,
     similarly to other platforms;  (further; it had accidentally been
     broken in ESS 5.6 on all platforms)

   Changes/New Features in 5.6:
   * [R]: help() calls have to differ from old default, with newer
     versions of R; currently via .help.ESS <- function(...) hack.

   Changes/New Features in 5.4:
   * [SAS]: The long overdue change from `make-regexp' to `regexp-opt'
     for font-locking is complete.  The new `regexp-opt' is now the
     default since it is better than the old code in many ways (and
     especially more maintainable).  However, there are certainly some
     special cases missed (bug reports and patches welcome!).  Setting
     `ess-sas-run-regexp-opt' to `nil' will result in the old code
     being used.

   * [BUGS] and [JAGS]: typing `=' now results in  `<-'.

   * [R] function arguments "show" `(ess-r-args-show)' now  uses the
     new `(tooltip-show-at-point)' contributed by Erik Iverson.

   * Toolbar icons now also work in (beta) Emacs 23.
